# Advent of Code 2024
Try it by yourself on [AoC2024](https://adventofcode.com/)

## What you can find here?
This small repo contains my attempts of Advent of Code challenges for 2024 season.

For this year I've decided to dive back into Go.

`I can't assure you that all days will be commited to this repo due to limited resources.`

## Repo organization
Each day/challenge is pushed to separate folder where you can find:
+ brief description of the problem
+ example input provided with AoC task
+ input I've downloaded for me
+ .go file with my solution named `aoc-d<n>.go`
